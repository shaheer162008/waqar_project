            <LighterText className="mt-4">
              Domestic violence by a spouse, parent, child or sibling is
              becoming more and more common. Domestic violence encompasses acts
              of physical, psychological, sexual, verbal and financial undue
              force. While this area can be treated as a criminal case in more
              severe scenarios, the matter can be taken before a family bench
              too. Given the fact that Pakistan has special legislation against
              domestic abuse, we levy this while unequivocally arguing your case
              so that you can get the best possible remedy. This can take the
              form of damages, interim and restraining orders, khulas/divorce
              and obtaining FIRs. Unfortunately, clients lack the awareness of
              the same due to which there are many people who are unheard. We
              make sure to spread Awareness and deter the perpetrator of the
              violence by taking them before court.
